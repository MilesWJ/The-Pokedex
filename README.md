# Required Packages
- PyPokedex 1.6.0 —— https://pypi.org/project/pypokedex/
- Tkinter —— https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html
- AudioPlayer 0.6 —— https://pypi.org/project/audioplayer/

# How To Use?
To use the Pokédex, simply enter the national dex ID or name of the Pokémon. If you search for a valid Pokémon, a bright sound can be heard, and information on the Pokémon will display. If you enter an invalid national dex ID or name, an error sound effect can be heard, and nothing will display. If you would like to view the shiny form variant of the Pokémon's sprite, tick the button at the bottom of the application. The next Pokémon you search for will display its shiny form sprite variant.

# Additional Notes
- If you wish to search for a Pokémon's variant form, you must follow the name of the Pokémon up with a hypen and the form name. (Ex. Raichu-Alola or Charizard-Mega-X)
- To search for a Pokémon by name like Giratina who are in one form or another, the search must be formated with a hypen then the form name. (Ex. Giratina-Origin)
